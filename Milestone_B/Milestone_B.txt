#   CSE 415 Milestone B

(a) The project we chose is Hidden Markov Model Applications. We will apply
	Hidden Markov Model on two applications: finding dishonesty in casino, and
	weather forecasting. The techniques that we used in this project are two 
	algorithms of Hidden Markov Model: Forward Algorithm and Viterbi Algorithm.
	Also, we used dynamic programming technique to implement Viterbi Algorithm.
	The weather forecasting application is based on the Forward Algorithm, and
	finding dishonesty in casino is based on Viterbi Algorithm. 
(b) By the time we submitting Milestone B, we have finished the implementation
	of Viterbi algorithm and have tested the code with the data generated by 
	ourselves. The application we implemented is trying to find whether a
	gambler is using loaded dice and which kind of loaded dice is being used (
	the dice is more likely to to tossed to a certain value). For small size of
	data the alogorithm has an accuracy of 60% approximately. However, for a
	larger size of data the accuracy would decrease. As the value becomes small
	so the prediction would be less accurate. The forward algorithm and weather
	prediction would be the task for the next stage.
